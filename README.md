# Tour Of Heroes

This project follows the Angular Tour of Heroes tutorial, except I have redone the website with React and Vite.

## Development server

Run `npm run dev` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:5173/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. To see a production version use `npm run preview`

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test:ui` for a visual feedback of the tests. Optionally, you can also use `npm run test` for a command line version.
